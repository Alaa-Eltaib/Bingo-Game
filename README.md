## Description
This is a simple console-based Bingo game for two players. Each player gets a randomly generated Bingo card and takes turns selecting numbers. The first player to complete a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## How to Play
1. Enter names for Player 1 and Player 2.
2. Each player will be assigned a Bingo card with numbers.
3. Players take turns choosing numbers.
4. The number is removed from both cards if present.
5. The first player to form a complete row, column, or diagonal wins.
